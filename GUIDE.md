# The ask field guide

`ask` does one job: it turns a message into an answer.

The shell supplies the message. `ask` supplies the judgment. The shell uses
the answer.

```text
collect data  ->  ask  ->  inspect or act
```

This separation explains the interface. `ask` has no filesystem tools and
runs no commands. If the model needs a fact, put that fact in the message.

## Choose the conversation first

A plain `ask` starts a new conversation. Continuing is explicit.

```sh
ask 'Explain this interface.'       # new conversation
ask -c 'Now give one example.'      # continue current
ask 'Review this file.' < x.go      # another new conversation
ask -f audit.jsonl 'Begin audit.'   # named conversation
```

Use these rules:

- Interactive follow-up: use `-c`.
- Independent script: plain `ask` is already fresh.
- Work with a stable name: use `-f file.jsonl`.
- Parallel work: plain invocations are independent; use distinct `-f` paths
  for named threads.

One session has one writer. A second writer is refused because interleaved
turns would no longer describe one conversation.
`note` without `-f` and `compact` without a session argument also require a
valid `current` pointer. For named threads, pass the session explicitly.

## Form the message

Arguments are the instruction. Text on stdin is the evidence.

```sh
git diff | ask 'Write a commit message.'
go test ./... 2>&1 | ask 'Explain the first useful failure.'
ask 'Explain compare-and-swap in two sentences.'
```

If both are present, `ask` sends the instruction followed by stdin inside
`<stdin>` delimiters. If only stdin is present, stdin is the whole message.
Surrounding whitespace on textual stdin is removed.

If stdin is normalized `context/v1` JSONL, Ask records an evidence manifest on
the same user event. The snapshot itself is still the message the model saw;
the manifest adds its digest and byte location plus ordered provenance fields.
It is an index, not a second copy and not another event stream. The same
recognition works when Ply has already placed Context JSONL inside the standard
`<stdin>` envelope before handing the composed turn to Ask.

This is also how to provide facts the model cannot know:

```sh
date -u | ask 'State this time in ISO 8601.'
uname -a | ask 'Explain this platform string.'
```

Do not ask the model to open `/tmp/x`, inspect the current repository, or run
`date`. It cannot. Let the shell do those operations and pass their results.

## Request a machine-readable answer

Use `-schema` when another program will consume JSON.

```sh
cat > finding.schema.json <<'JSON'
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "found": {"type": "boolean"},
    "reason": {"type": "string"}
  },
  "required": ["found", "reason"],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
JSON

ask -q -schema finding.schema.json \
  'Does this log show an out-of-memory failure?' < kernel.log |
  jq -e '.found'
```

The provider receives its native structured-output parameter. After the turn,
`ask` parses the text and validates the value against the same schema before
exit 0.
Large integers and precise decimals retain their exact values in both the
provider request and the local check.

A refusal, invalid JSON, schema mismatch, or incomplete provider stop exits 1
without emitting a normal answer. The completed provider turn remains in the
log. `-json` is different by request: it emits the raw events even when the
structured answer is rejected.

The schema is limited to 1 MB and must be one JSON object. Local fragment
references work. External references do not. With `-schema -`, stdin contains
the schema, so put the question in argv.

Cerebras supports native schemas through `-m cerebras/MODEL`. DeepSeek's
Chat API provides JSON mode only, so `-m deepseek/MODEL` refuses `-schema`
before creating a session. It does not insert a schema instruction into the
prompt. Both connectors accept `-header-fd` from the external OAuth filter;
API keys use `CEREBRAS_API_KEY` and `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, respectively.

## Attach files

Use `-a` for a regular file:

```sh
ask -a chart.png 'State the trend.'
ask -a old.pdf -a new.pdf 'List the changed claims.'
```

The order of `-a` flags is preserved. Type is determined from content:

- Recognized media becomes an attachment.
- Valid UTF-8 without NUL bytes becomes labelled text.
- Other bytes are refused.

Binary stdin is treated as one attachment:

```sh
screencapture -x -t png - | ask 'Describe this image.'
```

Provider families differ:

| provider | media |
| --- | --- |
| Anthropic | images, PDF |
| OpenAI and OpenAI Codex | images, PDF |
| Gemini | images, audio, video, PDF |
| OpenRouter | images, PDF, WAV, MP3 |

The check is per provider, not per model. A model can support less.

Files are read whole. `-a` accepts at most 16 files, 16 MB each and 32 MB in
total. Stdin has its own 16 MB limit. Too much input is an error, never a
partial message.

## Let the shell make the decision

Exit 0 means the model answered. It does not mean the answer was “yes.” Test
the answer itself.

The examples below are Bash scripts. `set -o pipefail` makes an upstream
failure count as a pipeline failure; without it, the status comes only from
the last command. Capture the answer successfully before interpreting it, so
a failed call cannot be mistaken for “no.”

For prose:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -o pipefail
if answer=$(git diff --staged |
  ask -q 'Does this change authentication? Answer yes or no.'); then
  case "$answer" in
    yes) echo 'security review required' ;;
    no)  echo 'no authentication change reported' ;;
    *)   echo 'unexpected answer' >&2; exit 1 ;;
  esac
else
  exit "$?"
fi
```

For automation, structured JSON is safer:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -o pipefail
if result=$(ask -q -schema finding.schema.json \
  'Does this change authentication?' < patch.json); then
  decision=$(printf '%s\n' "$result" | jq -r '.found') || exit "$?"
  case "$decision" in
    true)  echo 'security review required' ;;
    false) echo 'no authentication change reported' ;;
    *)     echo 'unexpected decision' >&2; exit 1 ;;
  esac
else
  exit "$?"
fi
```

Model output is untrusted input. Do not pipe it into `sh` or `eval` unless
you have chosen to execute untrusted text.

## Replace a file only after success

A redirection such as `ask ... > answer.txt` truncates the destination before
Ask runs. Write a temporary file beside the destination, then rename it only
after the pipeline succeeds:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -o pipefail
tmp=$(mktemp ./release-note.XXXXXX) || exit 1
trap 'rm -f -- "$tmp"' EXIT
if git diff --staged | ask -q 'Write a release note.' > "$tmp"; then
  mv -- "$tmp" release-note.txt
else
  exit "$?"
fi
```

The same-directory rename replaces the destination atomically. A failed input
command, model call, or output write leaves the previous destination intact.

## Run independent work in parallel

Plain calls create independent sessions, so they can run in parallel. Output
still needs a key because processes finish out of order.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
out=$(mktemp -d ./reviews.XXXXXX) || exit 1
pids=()
files=()
i=0
for file in *.go; do
  [ -f "$file" ] || continue
  i=$((i + 1))
  key=$(printf '%06d' "$i")
  files+=("$out/$key")
  (
    tmp="$out/$key.tmp"
    trap 'rm -f -- "$tmp"' EXIT
    ask -q "Review $file in five lines." < "$file" > "$tmp" || exit "$?"
    mv -- "$tmp" "$out/$key"
  ) &
  pids+=("$!")
done
status=0
for pid in "${pids[@]}"; do
  wait "$pid" || status=$?
done
[ "$status" -eq 0 ] || exit "$status"
if [ "${#files[@]}" -gt 0 ]; then
  cat -- "${files[@]}"
fi
```

Each job publishes its output only after success. Waiting for each PID exposes
failed jobs; `wait` without arguments does not report their individual statuses.
The fresh output directory avoids mixing this run with stale answers.

Each plain call gets its own session. Numbered files restore input order.
Do not run parallel `-c` calls: only one writer may hold a session.
After parallel plain calls, which one is `current` is unspecified; name any
thread whose identity matters with `-f`.

## Handle limits and retries

`ask` retries retryable provider failures up to six attempts. Retry waits and
causes are recorded in the session. Model streams have no overall deadline;
use the operating system's `timeout` command, or `gtimeout` from GNU
coreutils on macOS, when a caller needs one.

An output-token cutoff, missing stream completion, or another non-successful
stop exits 1 with no normal answer on stdout. The log keeps the terminal turn;
a failed stream is recorded as partial and is skipped when continuing.
`-json` still provides the raw events, and `replay` can display the saved text.
This tightens earlier behavior that could report a truncated answer as success;
existing logs retain their original folds. Reported stdout write errors also
exit 1; closed downstream pipes retain Unix SIGPIPE behavior.

`-max-tokens` must be greater than zero. Gemini's SDK caps the value at
2147483647; each model may impose a smaller limit. A failed session write,
sync, or close also exits 1. If recording a retry fails, Ask stops before
another model call. Normal stdout is emitted only after the log closes
successfully; `-json` events may already have streamed before an I/O failure.

Exit 2 has one meaning: a model context window is full. For an ask turn, do
not retry the same session. Either start over:

```sh
ask 'Restate the task with only the needed input.'
```

or compact the session:

```sh
new=$(ask compact) || exit "$?"
ask -f "$new" 'Continue with the next case.'
```

Compaction is explicit because a model decides what the handoff retains. The
source is unchanged. The summarizer call has its own session, and the new
session names both its parent and summarizer. Compaction verifies the source
snapshot before calling the model. A rejected source creates no files; a failed
summary keeps its own log but creates no handoff and does not move `current`.

## Inspect the record

Use replay for four different questions:

```sh
ask replay                 # What happened?
ask replay -json           # What events are stored?
ask replay -check          # Does every request match its preceding fold?
ask replay -step 4         # What normalized request was made at seq 4?
```

`-check` is stronger than “the JSON parses.” For every request event, it
folds all preceding user and complete assistant events and compares that
conversation with the recorded digest.

For Context evidence, the same check reconstructs the manifest from the exact
recorded message bytes. It therefore detects changes to the evidence snapshot
or to indexed refs, citations, retrieval query, and connector fingerprint.
No source is contacted during replay. Ask remains the single log writer; a
coordinator such as Ply may append Cite's verdict through `ask note`, but Cite
itself has no session access.

Use `note` for an attributed fact that belongs in the record but should not
become model context:

```sh
go test ./... >/tmp/test.out 2>&1
status=$?
ask note -s test "exit $status"
```

A note has no model call and is not folded. `-s` is required so the record
says who wrote it.

## Control the system prompt

Print the built-in value with `ask system`:

```sh
ask -S "$(ask system; cat project-style.md)" 'Draft the release note.'
ask -S '' 'Answer with no system prompt.'
```

Precedence is simple:

1. Explicit `-S`, including `-S ''`.
2. `$ASK_SYSTEM`.
3. The built-in prompt.

The choice is made again on every invocation. A one-time `-S` does not become
the default for later turns; export `ASK_SYSTEM` or pass `-S` again when it
must remain in force. The session header records the creation prompt, and each
request records the prompt used for that call.

## Keep sessions usable

Sessions contain the resulting user messages and the bytes of every media
attachment. Treat them like their inputs. Useful maintenance commands are:

```sh
for file in ~/.ask/sessions/*.jsonl; do
  ask replay -check "$file" >/dev/null || echo "bad: $file"
done

cp ~/.ask/sessions/SESSION.jsonl experiment.jsonl
ask -f experiment.jsonl 'Try the other assumption.'
```

Copying is the exact branch operation because a session is self-contained.

## Reference card

```text
ask 'question'                  start a new conversation
ask -c 'question'               continue the current conversation
ask -f thread.jsonl 'question'  use a named conversation
command | ask 'instruction'     combine evidence and instruction
ask -a file 'instruction'       attach a file; repeat -a as needed
ask -schema schema.json 'task'  require validated JSON

ask replay                     render the current session
ask replay -check              verify request digests
ask replay -step N             reconstruct one normalized request
ask compact                    continue from a model-written handoff
ask note -s source 'text'      append a record, not a message

-q          suppress progress on stderr; errors still print
-json       emit raw events instead of the normal answer
-effort     off, low, medium, high, or xhigh; mapping varies by provider
-max-tokens maximum output tokens; default 16384; refused by openai-codex
-m          provider/model

exit 0  success
exit 1  error
exit 2  context window full
exit 130 interrupted
```
