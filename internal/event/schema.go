// Package event defines ask's append-only session log.
//
// A session is one JSONL file of events. Context-bearing events determine
// what the model sees: Fold projects them into the conversation. Everything
// else is telemetry and is ignored by Fold. Each LLM call is preceded by a
// request event holding the exact normalized request, with its conversation
// recorded as a digest rather than a second copy, which makes replay
// self-verifying: Fold over the events before a request must reproduce it
// (see Check).
